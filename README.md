INTRODUCTION

Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and functionality based on business requirements. When a new system is developed, typically the process begins with a business analyst gathering and writing these business requirements, with the assistance of subject matter experts from the business. Then a system analyst works with several application team members and others to formulate a solution based on the requirements. As a developer, you would then create a design document from the solution and finally develop the system based on your design document.

For this assessment, you will create a C# application using the solution statements provided in the requirements section.

The skills you showcase in your completed application will be useful in responding to technical interview questions for future employment. This application may also be added to your portfolio to show to future employers.

Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application.

Note: The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for this assignment is Visual Studio. Refer to your course of study for instructions on how to install and use this application. If you choose to use another IDE, you must export your project into Visual Studio format for submission.

Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. The zip file submission must also keep the project file and folder structure intact for the Visual Studio IDE.

SCENARIO

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached “GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. A system analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section based on the manufacturing organization’s business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
